# AdventOfCode2020

My solutions to the [Advent Of Code 2020 ](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles written in Javascript

## Requirements

- Node.js installed

- As of Day 14, I started to write tests using [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha). Install it by running:

>`npm install --global mocha`

>The tests also use [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) for assertion and [Sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon) for test-spies

- A shell of your choice to run the solutions (PowerShell, Bash...)

### To Run a Solution (PowerShell)

Example: To run Day 1

`cd "Day 1"`

`node day1.js`

## Comments

~~Second half of Day 13 still not good, couldn't find a way to optimize :( (Math: 10 x Me:0)~~

*Finally found a solution to second half Day 13 that is optimized yaaaaay! maybe I will explain it in another file (EDIT: not)*

*Day 15, looking at it again I regret not writing an algorithm after finding the best solution*

*Day 17 was interesting, working with 3 dimensions was tough then (boom!!!), second part comes!!*

*Writing tests is actually fun*
