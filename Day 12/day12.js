    Algorithm for Day 12 - First puzzle
    
    1. create an object to store the values { north, south, east, west, direction }
    2. loop
    3. read the instruction
    4. if F decrement the oposite direction by the value then increment the actual direction by the remainder
    5. if L change direction depending on the value (in degrees) ex: 90 facing north changes to west
    6. if R change direction depending on the value (in degrees) ex: 90 facing north changes to east
    7. if N decrement south by the value then increment north by the remainder
    8. if S decrement north by the value then increment south by the remainder
    9. if E decrement west by the value then increment east by the remainder
    10. if W decrement east by the value then increment west by the remainder
    11. result is the sum of all directions
