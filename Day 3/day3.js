    Algorithm for Day 3 - First puzzle

    1. Set the horizontal limit in which the layout repeats itself (this will be the length of the line on the map)
    2. "move to the right" by adding the constant of 3 on x
    3. "move down" by adding the constant of 1 on y which is theMap iterator
    4. if x is higher then horizontal limit then substrct horizontal limit from x
    5. get the element on y and x coordinates of the map
    6. if it's a # add a tree on trees

    Algorithm for Day 3 - Second puzzle

    1. Create an array of slopes

    3. Loop through the slopes
    2. "move to the right" on the current slope
    3. "move down" on the current slope
    4. if x is higher then horizontal limit then substrct horizontal limit from x

    6. if it's a # add a tree on trees
    7. multiply number of trees on each slope
